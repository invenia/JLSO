JLSO is a storage container for serialized Julia objects.  
JLSO is less of a serialization format and moreso a container which employs a serializer, a compressor, and handles all other concerns involving metadata and saving.  
JLSOs serializer simply needs to determine how to turn a Julia object into a stream `Vector{UInt8}`, and the compressor simply needs to determine how to turn one stream of `UInt8`s into a smaller one or the reverse.

In JLSO it's fast and efficient to load single objects out of a larger file containing many objects.  
Objects represent data. 
At the top-level is a BSON file which stores metadata about the host operating system environment as well as an arbitrary collection of objects.
Depending on configuration metadata objects may be stored as BSON sub-documents, or using native Julia serialization formats with various levels of compression. 
Serialization in Julia currently defaults to `gzip`.

JLSO metadata stored in BSON without any Julia specific extensions includes: the Julia version and the versions of all packages installed.  
Unfortunately this means one might accidentally install everything again and replicate their system. 
Even harder problems will arise when using a BSON reader in another programming language.

Note that if the amount of data you have to store is small relative to the metadata about your environment then JLSO is a suboptimal format.

## Example

```jldoctest
julia> using JLSO, Dates

julia> JLSO.save("breakfast.jlso", :food => "☕️🥓🍳", :cost => 11.95, :time => Time(9, 0))

julia> loaded = JLSO.load("breakfast.jlso")
Dict{Symbol,Any} with 3 entries:
  :cost => 11.95
  :food => "☕️🥓🍳"
  :time => 09:00:00
```
